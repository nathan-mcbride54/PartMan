# Changelog

All notable implementation changes are recorded here. Specification changes
remain controlled by the changelog in `AGENT_BUILD_SPEC.md`.

## Unreleased

### Added

- WP-000 repository foundation: pinned Rust workspace, Tier-1 task runner,
  cross-platform CI, formatting/lint policy, dependency policy, and ADR
  template.
- `cargo xtask verify-actions` enforces SEC-010 digest pinning for GitHub
  Actions. It runs inside `cargo xtask ci` and as a Tier-1 test, and fails
  closed when no workflow can be read.
- `.gitattributes` normalizes line endings to LF in every working tree.
- `LICENSE-APACHE` and `LICENSE-MIT` supply the dual license already declared
  in `Cargo.toml`.
- `SECURITY.md` defines a private disclosure channel and reporting scope.
- Job timeouts on both CI jobs.

### Changed

- `xtask` separates command parsing from execution, so every documented task,
  rejected task, and tier decision is unit-tested without launching a
  subprocess.
- Removed `[build] rustflags = ["-Dwarnings"]` from `.cargo/config.toml`. Cargo
  discovers that file from the working directory, so the flag applied to every
  crate compiled from anywhere inside the repository: third-party dependencies,
  out-of-workspace manifests, and the supply-chain job's
  `cargo install cargo-deny`, which built its entire dependency tree under
  `-D warnings`. That tree compiles warning-free today, so nothing was failing
  yet, but the exposure grows with every dependency added and every rustc
  release that introduces a lint. Workspace lint scope now comes from
  `[workspace.lints]`, and `cargo xtask ci` still fails on any warning in
  workspace code through `cargo clippy -- -D warnings`.

### Fixed

- Windows could not pass `cargo fmt --check`. Git for Windows sets
  `core.autocrlf=true` in its system configuration by default, and the
  GitHub-hosted `windows-*` runner images do not override it, so checkout
  produced CRLF working-tree files that `newline_style = "Unix"` rejects.
  `.gitattributes` now pins LF in every working tree.
