# PartMan

PartMan is a safety-first, cross-platform disk partition manager defined by
`AGENT_BUILD_SPEC.md` 4.1.0. The intended product is a dark-first Tauri desktop
application plus a scriptable CLI, backed by a shared Rust domain, planner,
validator, journal, image engine, and per-platform privileged helpers.

## Current status

**Not a usable partition manager, and must not be represented as one.** Nothing
here discovers, plans, or mutates storage. There is no GUI, no planner, and no
privileged helper. A read-only CLI exists — argument parsing, a documented
exit-code contract, a schema-versioned JSON envelope, a typed refusal
vocabulary, a dependency doctor, technology facts, and adapter-attributed
observation records over replayed regular files — and it observes no real
device yet: `partman inspect` without `--replay` answers with a typed
no-adapter statement naming the platform package that changes that, because
printing a plausible empty machine would be a fake success path. ADR-0009's
off-main Slint 1.17.1 candidate was rejected and closed without merge; only
its reproducible evidence record lands here.

What does exist:

- Repository foundation: pinned toolchain, three-OS CI, the `xtask` task
  runner, dependency and lint policy (WP-000).
- The `pce/1` canonical encoding: a byte-exact encoder, a strict validating
  decoder, and SHA-256 hashing, implemented in Rust (`crates/domain`) and
  TypeScript (`packages/canonical`) and proven to agree (WP-010, increments 1
  and 2). Schema-declared sets now have a separate cross-language producer and
  validator: full element encodings sort by unsigned byte order, duplicates
  fail closed, and element sort keys inherit their enclosing depth (increment
  2a, MODEL-006). Ordinary arrays and all existing `pce/1` hashes are unchanged.
- The design tokens and the accessibility harness that computes WCAG 2.2 AA
  contrast, redundant non-colour channels, and colour-vision separation from
  them (WP-030 increment 1). There is still no user interface for them to
  style.
- A strict 41-row ADR-0009 Slint feasibility report. It records one pass, hard
  failures at `G-CFG-08` and `G-SC-01`, and 38 inconclusive rows, together with
  immutable candidate/artifact identities and explicit accessibility/platform
  gaps. No Slint runtime or renderer dependency is present on main.
- The `partman` CLI chassis (WP-035 increments 1–4): structured argv that
  owns the non-Unicode seam as a typed refusal instead of a panic, exit codes
  pinned by test, an ANSI-free schema-versioned envelope
  (`partman.cli.envelope/0`, provisional within major version 0), and the
  typed refusal vocabulary. Its shipped dependency closure is empty and its
  output type carries a compile-fail non-`Hash` proof — both guards' exact
  reach is stated in the crate, and domain payloads are absent from every
  surface rather than emitted unversioned. `export-diagnostics` emits this
  build's identity and surface states through a deny-by-default field
  allowlist that is the builder's type rather than a filter; every field is
  compile-time data, the missing discovery evidence is an in-band typed
  refusal, and redaction tests — an exact-field pin, a byte-pinned human
  rendering, an environment-value tripwire, and an env-read source guard —
  gate the tier. `doctor` reports roster tools at compiled absolute paths —
  present, version, in or out of the recorded tested range — as facts with
  provenance under SAFE-004's launch discipline, with an empty platform
  roster carried as a typed statement; `facts` ships FS-007's inputs, five
  immutable technology limits each with its basis, mechanically refused the
  CAP-003 status vocabulary that belongs to WP-050. `inspect` answers with
  adapter-attributed observation records: `--replay` runs the fixture-replay
  adapter over one regular file — refused unread if it is anything else,
  with fstat through the opened handle as the authority — reporting bytes
  as hex that no code classifies, with ADR-C4's outcome vocabulary as the
  ADR wrote it (observed, with absence as a value; unavailable; failed) and
  the standing gated list (SI-28, SI-35, SI-12) carried in-band in every
  answer, refusals included.

The domain crate performs no I/O and launches no process. Tier 2 and Tier 3
test suites fail closed and cannot run at all yet.

## Safe local gate

```text
cargo xtask ci
```

Verifies the pinned toolchain, GitHub Action digest pinning, formatting,
linting, and Tier-1 Rust tests. Tier 1 never requires elevation and contains no
destructive storage operations.

```text
cargo xtask cross-language
```

Proves that Rust and TypeScript produce identical hashes for identical content
(MODEL-005). It needs a Node toolchain, so it is deliberately **not** part of
`cargo xtask ci`; CI runs it as its own required job so the proof cannot be
silently skipped.

```text
cargo xtask test --tier 1
```

Tier 2 and Tier 3 still refuse. The SAFE-007 interlock now exists and is
exercised (WP-020 increment 1), but no destructive suite is registered yet, and
reporting a pass for a run of nothing would be a fake success path.

Run `cargo xtask help` for the full command list.

## Roadmap

Milestones and their exit criteria are normative in Section 13 of the build
specification; work-package order is normative in Section 14. This section
reports status only and never redefines either.

### M0 — Foundations (in progress)

| Exit criterion | Status |
| --- | --- |
| CI green on Windows, macOS, and Linux | Met |
| `xtask` single entry point works locally and in CI | Met |
| Schemas versioned, with cross-language hash golden tests (MODEL-005) | Partial — the golden tests exist and gate CI; MODEL-003 schema versioning is not implemented |
| CODEOWNERS enforces ownership | Partial — `cargo xtask verify-change-ownership` now rejects a diff touching paths outside the assignment its commits declare, judged against the base revision. CODEOWNERS itself still only requires an owner's review, and sub-file grants ("this package's own status rows") stay a review obligation no path checker can express |
| T1 fixture generator produces images | Met — `cargo xtask fixtures` produces 13 images deterministically (WP-020 increment 1) |
| Accessibility harness runs | Partial — `cargo xtask tokens` computes UI-001/007/008 from `schemas/design-tokens.json` and gates CI (WP-030 increment 1). The rejected Slint report keeps all ten `G-AX-*` rows inconclusive; it confirms rather than closes the missing keyboard, screen-reader, zoom, text-spacing, high-contrast, rendered-state, and reduced-motion evidence |

The three partial rows are tracked as known gaps in
`docs/work-packages/WP-000.md`, `docs/work-packages/WP-010.md`, and
`docs/work-packages/WP-030.md`. They are recorded rather than rounded up: a
milestone that exits on a criterion nobody verified is worse than one that exits
late.

### M0.5 through M5

Not started. Their themes and exit criteria are in Section 13 of the
specification and are not restated here, because a second copy of a normative
table is a second copy to drift.

## Work-package order

Section 14 of the specification is normative. Current state:

| Package | Stage | Scope | Status |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| WP-000 | Foundations (M0) | Repository, CI, `xtask`, CODEOWNERS, dependency policy | In progress. Lock boundary, licence, fuzz-graph and ownership-inventory gates delivered; action discovery is now a structural YAML parse after three text-based attempts were each defeated, and the Dockerfile scanner behind it fails closed after nine further bypasses were found and made regressions. Ownership is enforced against a change, not only inventoried, and a generated lockfile may travel with the manifest it follows. `unsafe_code = "deny"` is no longer opt-in per crate. All four current `docs/traceability/WP-*.md` files are generated from source-local test annotations and typed evidence declarations, anchored to real requirement definitions and numeric specification sections, and cross-checked against live tests, tracked/owned paths, and xtask's parser. Each hand-written predecessor has an exact zero-loss migration ledger, and a hand edit fails CI. Issue #39 is closed; WP-000 remains in progress for its other documented gaps rather than being rounded up by this one completion. |
| ADR-C1 | — | Canonical encoding and hash strategy | Accepted |
| ADR-C2 … ADR-C6 | — | Hashed-artifact body/envelope split, identity strength, provenance shape, aggregation vocabulary, canonical set ordering and depth | Accepted |
| WP-010 | Foundations (M0); increment 3 blocked on the spec-issue register | Canonical domain model, schema versioning, encoding and hashing | In progress. SI-31 is resolved by the delivered schema-set boundary, and traceability is generated with a zero-loss migration ledger; increment 3 remains blocked by the authoritative issue register. See `docs/work-packages/WP-010.md` |
| WP-020 | Foundations (M0) | Disk-image fixture generator and destructive-test interlocks | In progress — increments 1–1g and 2a–2d delivered. Preconditions 1 and 3 are now closed on both platforms (issue #51): Unix opens a direct child relative to a held root object, Windows holds the root with a share mode the filesystem enforces, and the other-name refusal — which was a **live defect**, not a missing check — now reads the link count through the authorized handle everywhere. Windows containment is enforcement by the filesystem rather than resolution from a handle, so it is **unproven for roots that are not on a local volume**, and non-local roots are refused. WP-020 traceability is generated from validated source-local claims and typed evidence, with a source-revision/blob ledger preserving every former evidence row, correction, limitation, and residual risk. Tier 2 stays unavailable on every platform because no destructive suite exists; see `docs/work-packages/WP-020.md` |
| WP-030 | Foundations (M0); desktop shell deferred, no authority on main | Design tokens, dark UI shell, accessibility harness | In progress — increments 1 through 1c delivered (tokens, the static accessibility harness, and zero-loss generated traceability). Increment 2S's bounded Slint 1.17.1 branch was implemented, measured, mechanically rejected on two hard gates, and closed without merge. Main now retains only normalized evidence, the byte-reproducible 41-row report, and accessibility limitations; no shell exists, UI-002 remains unimplemented, and the rendered half of UI-008 remains untested. The temporary implementation authority was retired by PR #91, so no desktop-shell path is authorized on main and reviving either off-main branch needs fresh governance rather than inertia |

| WP-035 | Evidence (M0.5) | Read-only CLI chassis and evidence instrument | In progress — increments 1–4 delivered: the chassis (structured argv owning the non-Unicode seam as a typed refusal, exit codes pinned by test, the ANSI-free schema-versioned envelope `partman.cli.envelope/0` provisional within major version 0, the typed refusal vocabulary, the empty-shipped-closure and compile-fail non-`Hash` guards with their reach stated); the redacted `export-diagnostics` (a deny-by-default field allowlist that is the builder's type, compile-time-only field values, the missing discovery evidence carried as an in-band typed refusal, and redaction tests — exact-field pin, byte-pinned human rendering, environment-value tripwire, env-read source guard, byte-determinism — gating the tier); and the dependency doctor and technology facts (roster tools probed at compiled absolute paths only under SAFE-004's launch discipline through a launcher seam that keeps roster launches out of Tier 1, presence/version/tested-range reported as facts with provenance, an empty platform roster as a typed statement, and FS-007's five input facts mechanically refused CAP-003's status vocabulary). `partman inspect` now answers: adapter-attributed observation records with ADR-C4's outcome vocabulary as the ADR wrote it (observed, with absence as a value; unavailable; failed) over `--replay`ed regular files (verified through the opened handle, so a device named by path is refused unread), bytes reported as hex and never classified, no path echo, and the standing gated list — SI-28, SI-35, SI-12 — carried in-band in every answer, refusals included; without `--replay` the answer is a typed no-adapter statement naming the platform package, never a plausible empty machine. The package remains forbidden every surface the spec-issue register's open items gate; see `docs/work-packages/WP-035.md` for the boundary. Every increment was adversarially reviewed before push; the corrections forced are recorded in the commit history |

Stage labels name Section 13's milestone themes where one exists; the deferred
desktop shell has none while its authority stays retired. Each label is carried
as a `- Stage:` bullet in its assignment document, and Section 14's milestone
column is normative — this column never overrides it.

WP-020 and WP-030 depend only on WP-000 and could begin in parallel. WP-040 is
the first package gated on WP-010. WP-035 depends on WP-000 and WP-020 only,
which is the point: it is the instrument intended to take the outstanding
measurements the register's blockers name as prerequisite evidence, so it
precedes rather than waits on the blocked Section 5 model (WP-010
increment 3).
